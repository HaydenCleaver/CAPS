#### LAB 11 - Resubmit

- Not sure why my original code was breaking so hard; but I moved the emitters to a seperate hub file rather than the eventPool. Then I refactored it with some heavy influence from Alan Chelko and Ryan Gallaway's demonstration in today's review.


#### Lab 12 - socket.io

- Implemented web socket functionality and refactored code.
